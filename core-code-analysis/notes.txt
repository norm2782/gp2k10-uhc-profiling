Generic code: 
- No differences between the final pass (16) of O0, O1 and O2.
- 27 differences between those and the final pass of O3 (17).

Non-generic code:
- No differences between the final pass (16) of O0, O1 and O2.
- 24 differences between those and the final pass of O3 (17).

Compared:
- On O0-O2, 75 diffs between generic and non-generic.
- On O3, there are 86 differences between generic and non-generic.
- Generic 17: 398 LOC, non-generic 17: 405 LOC
- Generic 16: 266 LOC, non-generic 16: 273 LOC

Observations:
- Even after the final Grin stage on O3, generic representations and embedding projection pairs are still present in the Grin code, while these are not present in the specific code.
- Without NoGenericDeriving, the non-generic code still contains embedding projection pairs and representations after Grin on O3, even though these are never used in the program. (mostly space issue, probably won't affect performance, since they're never used).
